# Dark mode: current assessment

<br>

In order to make dark mode work, we need to rely on a few items that work correctly and predictably across all email clients and configurations.

**This is not possible at this time** given the complexity of some email elements and unreliability of multiple email clients related to dark mode.

## Requirements to make dark mode work
1. The ability to switch images dynamically and reliably:
	- logos
	- social media icons
	- icons within buttons
2. Ability to control the color of buttons and the background color of the email body (Primary CTA, Secondary CTA)
