## Summary of the CSS stack in the html file of the same name

<br>

The provided code is a CSS stylesheet designed to manage the appearance of a webpage, specifically focusing on the display of logos in different color schemes and email clients.

The general styles section sets the default appearance for the webpage. The body element has no margin or padding, a white background (`#ffffff`), and black text (`#000000`). The `forced-color-adjust: none` and `color-scheme: light` properties ensure that the page maintains a light color scheme regardless of user settings.

The `.logo-container` class centers its content and applies a white background with 20 pixels of padding. This container holds the logos, which are styled differently based on the color scheme.

Two logo classes, `.logo-light` and `.logo-dark`, are defined. The `.logo-light` class is set to display as a block element, centered with a maximum width of 200 pixels. Conversely, the `.logo-dark` class is hidden by default but shares the same centering and width properties.

The stylesheet includes specific targeting for Gmail using the `u+body` selector. In Gmail, the `.logo-light` class is displayed, while the `.logo-dark` class is hidden. However, when the user's system prefers a dark color scheme, the media query `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` overrides these settings, hiding the `.logo-light` class and displaying the `.logo-dark` class instead.

Additionally, the stylesheet contains rules for Outlook's dark mode. The `[data-ogsc]` attribute selector targets elements in Outlook, ensuring the `.logo-light` class is displayed by default. When Outlook is in dark mode (`[data-ogsc][data-ogsb-mode="dark"]`), the `.logo-light` class is hidden, and the `.logo-dark` class is shown.

Overall, this CSS ensures that the appropriate logo is displayed based on the user's color scheme preferences and the email client being used, providing a consistent and visually appealing experience across different environments.
